As part of The Producers Series 2 for Red Bull and VICE, this short documentary focuses on South London producer Kwes. Although only 24 years old, this multi talented musician already has a production CV that most producers would kill for (The XX, The Invisible and Damon Albarn). Here Kwes, recently signed to Warp Records, works with some familiar faces and old friends (Ghostpoet, DELS and Clout) on a collaboration mixtape with artist Micachu.
