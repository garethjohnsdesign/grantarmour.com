In an age of unrest, narcissism and social media anxiety, VICE journalist, Hannah Ewens enters the superhuman world of empaths.

An empath is someone who feels the emotional, mental, or physical state of another person, or animal. So if you feel the earth's pain or have a panic attack because someone near you is anxious, you might be an empath too.

In science circles, the concept of empaths is dismissed as paranormal, but as we all struggle to fill the void, new age therapies are booming.

Hannah visits a community of empaths in New York to uncover the mysteries behind this phenomenon and find out if she is an empath herself.
