After meeting this summer at Nandoâ€™s Music Exchange in London, MOBO award winner Stormzy travelled to South Africa to check out the local music scene with producer Muzi. Noisey were there to document the trip as the two artists discovered their similarities, and Stormzy learnt about gqom music and Zulu culture.
