Now itâ€™s easy enough to book a flight to anywhere in the world, the tourism industry has its sight on the next frontier: space travel. In the second episode of our Voyager series, made possible by KAYAK.co.uk, Motherboard explores the existing space tourism industry to get a glimpse of where we might be holidaying in the future. We visit space travel agency Space Adventures, meet a space tourist who travelled to the International Space Station, and get the closest possible to space travel on Earth: a zero-gravity flight.
