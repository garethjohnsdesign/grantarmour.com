I"É<p>Indonesiaâ€™s punk scene is one of the worldâ€™s biggest and most vibrant. Itâ€™s a place where the countryâ€™s silenced youth can revolt against endemic corruption, social conventions and their strict families. But in the worldâ€™s largest Islamic nation, political authorities and religious fundamentalists persecute this rebellious youth movement. Nowhere is the anti-punk sentiment stronger than in Aceh, Indonesiaâ€™s only Sharia province, where 65 punks were arrested and detained at an Islamic moral training camp in which they had their heads shaved and clothes burnt. We travelled to North Sumatra to track down the last punks in Aceh, who still live under constant threat from the sharia police.</p>
