I"ø<p>Soon, virtual reality is going to crash into our lives in a way we never even imagined. Though dating and masturbating have long been commandeered by the web, itâ€™s only been as a kind of middleman. Now weâ€™re nearing the possibility of falling in love with your computer, as meeting your dream partner could be as easy as slipping on Oculus Riftâ€”the most advanced virtual reality headset in the world.
In Digital Love, VICE investigates how love and sex is faring in the digital age, starting with technologyâ€™s notorious bedmate, the adult entertainment industry. We make a pilgrimage to LAâ€™s â€œPorn Valleyâ€ to witness firsthand how virtual reality is scarily close to creating fully interactive porn before heading to Europeâ€™s sex capital, Amsterdam, where the Dutch enthusiastically enlist the use of â€œteledildonicsâ€ to enhance their long-distance relationships.</p>

<p>Along the way we pick apart the digital worldâ€™s grip on todayâ€™s relationships. Apps and the rise of social media have revolutionized dating, while virtual affairs end real-life romances and online role-playing games have gone X-rated. Finally, we takes a look at a very modern taboo and ask: Can manâ€™s relationship with machine ever translate into real-life intimacy?</p>
