&lt;p&gt;“Na Ponta dos Pes” (On Tiptoes) is a ballet project in the Alemão favela complex in Rio de Janeiro, created by Tuany Nascimento – a 23-year-old dancer who represented Brazil at international events during a flourishing career that was abruptly cut short by a lack of resources. Rather than letting her head drop, the setback strengthened Tuany’s determination to help troubled communities through dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuany started teaching classes in the Morro do Adeus favela, where she lives. It’s one of the roughest parts of Alemão, which is currently at the centre of a rolling feud between rival drug cartels and the military police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students in her group of girls, aged 4-15, come from families caught up in narco turf wars and afflicted by the chronic crisis of opportunity and urban poverty in the Favelas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an average 20 incidents of weapons fired every day in Rio, last year saw more than 100 police deaths – as well as hundreds more civilians, many of whom are caught in the crossfire of confrontations in their local areas.
Intensifying violence in Alemão heightens Tuany’s motivation to find support for the construction of a community centre, which will give her girls a safe space to dance and study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the challenges of her own career, Tuany knows her students can’t all become pro ballerinas – but the discipline she teaches will transcend the act of learning to dance, setting them up with a better chance to escape the bitter cycle of hardship which swallows up so many young lives in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of her lessons in a basketball court in the centre of the Morro do Adeus favela a shootout between rival gangs breaks out with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuany is forced to put the ballet school on hold due to escalating violence and until they can raise money for the new community centre so they can have a safe space to practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ballet and Bullets: Dancing Out of the Favela” was produced with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://grantarmour.com/uploads/Ballet_thumb.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://grantarmour.com/uploads/Ballet_thumb.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Make The World Greta Again</title><link href="http://grantarmour.com/projects/make-the-world-greta-again/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Make The World Greta Again" /><published>2019-07-29T21:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-07-29T21:25:00+00:00</updated><id>http://grantarmour.com/projects/make-the-world-greta-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://grantarmour.com/projects/make-the-world-greta-again/">&lt;p&gt;Upon realizing her generation won’t have a future unless the world’s politicians act now on climate change, then 15-year-old Greta Thunberg skipped school in August 2018 to protest outside the Swedish parliament.

Through her astrological research, she later finds out NASA remapped the stars and her birth date falls within the thirteenth star sign, Ophiuchus - The Serpent Bearer. Confused by her new identity, Eli delves into the history of Pocahontas. At the time Pocahontas was born, people had secret names that only a select few knew and they changed them on important occasions. She was called Rebecca when she died in Kent. One night while trying to contact Pocahontas from beyond the grave through her iPhone, Eli notices a familiar but malign presence following her in the car park of her apartment block. As a demonic virus takes over her iPhone, Eli is chased through an under populated city by a monstrous soul eating avatar as it attempts to absorb her identity forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Music written and performed by HEX ULTRA.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://grantarmour.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-28%20at%2011.37.19.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://grantarmour.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-28%20at%2011.37.19.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fetish Fight Club</title><link href="http://grantarmour.com/projects/fetish-fight-club/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fetish Fight Club" /><published>2018-03-05T11:42:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-05T11:42:00+00:00</updated><id>http://grantarmour.com/projects/fetish-fight-club</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://grantarmour.com/projects/fetish-fight-club/">&lt;p&gt;VICE enters the underground fetish wrestling community fuelled by social media site, MeetFighters.com - a dating site for gay men who fight each other for sexual gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the site set up wrestler profiles and send out match requests to organise no holds barred fights in living rooms, hotel rooms and makeshift rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fetish Fight Club, VICE follow Brit Pro Heel, a self-proclaimed “bad lad in the ring” and one of the most prolific fighters on the site, in the midst of an identity crisis as he decides to shut down his account and turn his back on the underground fetish scene to go pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitman321 speaks openly about his wrestling fetishes; dominating men in his living room by throwing them against walls and tying them up while he watches TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the community, Matworker and Small Gladiator hold monthly submission events where groups of middle aged gay men come together to put each other in holds and see how much pain they can take. They often trash talk each other in a form of roleplay and sometimes things get more sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
