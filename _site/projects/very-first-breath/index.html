  <p>Noisey is proud to present the full length of Very First Breath : A Film About Hudson Mohawke, where we travel with Ross back to his family home in Glasgow.
Hudmo has toured the world as one half of TNGHT and has collaborated with artists like Kanye West, Drake, and Rick Rubin - yet in stark contrast to the bright lights of international touring and his collaborations with high profile artists, Ross celebrates his homecoming with a last minute Trance &amp; Happy Hardcore rave, performing with his peers from the Glasgow scene, Rustie and Jackmaster.</p>
<p>This intimate look at Hudmo reveals an artist whose old friendships are still intact, and whose passion for production encourages affection from his fans.</p>
