It’s a place where the country’s silenced youth can revolt against endemic corruption, social conventions and their strict families. But in the world’s largest Islamic nation, political authorities and religious fundamentalists persecute this rebellious youth movement. Nowhere is the anti-punk sentiment stronger than in Aceh, Indonesia’s only Sharia province, where 65 punks were arrested and detained at an Islamic moral training camp in which they had their heads shaved and clothes burnt. We travelled to North Sumatra to track down the last punks in Aceh, who still live under constant threat from the sharia police."

If the situation stays as it is, South Koreans are predicted to become extinct by 2750. Because of the rapidly aging population, elderly prostitutes known as “Bacchus ladies” have cornered a number of public parks as their working areas. Meanwhile, South Korean kids are living with their families well into their 20s—as a result, an entire economy of sex motels has sprung up to give kids a place to fool around outside the watchful eyes of their parents. We sent Matt Shea to investigate this generational crisis, which led him to Seoul’s red-light district, a pre-wedding photo shoot on the set of a Korean soap opera, and an erotic sculpture park on South Korea’s “honeymoon island.”"

We make a pilgrimage to LA’s “Porn Valley” to witness firsthand how virtual reality is scarily close to creating fully interactive porn before heading to Europe’s sex capital, Amsterdam, where the Dutch enthusiastically enlist the use of “teledildonics” to enhance their long-distance relationships."
